                        <b style="font-size: 87%;font-family:sans-serif" >Now that Batman comics have revealed the moment Joker was truly born, the villain himself is giving his own perspective on his 'rebirth.'<br><br><br>The Batman mythology has been changed as far as The Joker is concerned, now that the comics have revealed the night the modern Joker was truly born. But before that dust has even settled, the clown is offering another version of events... one might call it his own origins, as he sees it.<br><br><br>With the highly-touted "Joker War" story coming to Batman and promising to be a new twist on the hero and villain's relationship, it's a fitting time for introspection, and the digging-up of old secrets. But no secret will pack the same punch as the latest revealed by Catwoman. As the city of Gotham has suddenly erupted into multiple overlapping master plans -- all with the mysterious Designer at the center -- Selina Kyle sees the truth. The Designer is launching the 'perfect crimes' they created under his guidance, years earlier. And now it's time for Joker to tell a story of his own.<br><br><br>The official offered by Selina painted the Designer as an experienced (immortal?) villain who had learned how to defeat his nemesis once and for all. And in the learning, evolve his thinking to a new, higher plane. In his own words:<br><br><br>When extending the chance for such an "exponential leap forward" to Catwoman, Riddler, and Penguin, the result was a flawless batch of schemes. But applied to The Joker, and even the Designer couldn't believe what he might have unlocked. Now in DC's official preview of Batman #91, it's Joker's turn to explain how that night's events transpired. And no surprise, he saw his meeting with the Devil a little differently. But did he see the Designer's true designs that the others missed? Or did he see the world in ways nobody else ever could? We'll let readers decide for themselves:</b>
